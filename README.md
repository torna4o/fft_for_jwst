# FFT for JWST
Processing JWST images with FFT - 

This repository is intended for putting all FFT-related convenience functions in my research regarding JWST imaging preprocessing and source finder.

You will need numpy, os, pathlib, and astropy packages. These can work even in Windows 10 environment, and also in Google Colab.
